# NeoVim configuration

My NeoVim configuration is currently based off of [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) ðŸ’¤

This is meant to be more of an IDE configuration, I wouldn't really call it 'lightweight'.

## Install Requirements

- a [Nerd Font](https://nerdfonts.com/)
- fzf
- lazygit
- ripgrep
- fd (alternative to GNU `find`)
- LSPs usually assume that you have the language tooling installed already (i.e. for Rust, install rust-analyzer with `rustup`)
